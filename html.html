      <ul id="tribute-info">
        <li><span class="bold">1961-</span> Peter Obi was born on 19 July 1961 in Onitsha, Anambra State, in a devout Christian family. He attended Christ the King College, Onitsha, where he completed his secondary school education.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1980-</span>He was admitted to the University of Nigeria</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1984-</span> He graduated with a B.A. (Hons) in Philosophy</li>
        <li><span class="bold">2003-</span>Peter Obi contested in the Anambra State Governorship Election as a candidate for the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) party; but his opponent, Chris Ngige of the People's Democratic Party, was declared winner by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC)</li>
        <li><span class="bold">2006-</span>After nearly three years of litigation, Ngige's victory was overturned by the Court of Appeal on 15 March 2006. Obi took office for governorship on 17 March 2006.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">2006-</span>He was impeached by the Anambra State House of Assembly, led by Hon. Mike Balonwu, after seven months in office and was replaced the next day by Virginia Etiaba, his deputy, making her the first-ever female governor in Nigeria's history.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">2007-</span></li>Obi successfully challenged his impeachment and was re-instated as the governor on 9 February 2007 by the Court of Appeal sitting in Enugu. Etiaba handed power back to him after the court ruling.
        <li><span class="bold">2007-</span>Peter Obi once again left office on 29 May 2007 following the General Elections, in which Andy Uba was declared the winner by the electoral body. Obi returned to the courts once more, this time contending that the four-year tenure he had won in the 2003 elections only started to run when he took office in March 2006. On 14 June 2007 the Supreme Court of Nigeria upheld Obi's contention and returned Obi to office. This brought to an abrupt end the tenure of Obi's successor, Andy Uba whose 14 April 2007 election the Supreme Court nullified on the grounds that Obi's four-year tenure should have remained undisturbed until March 2010</li>
        <li><span class="bold">2010-</span>On 7 February 2010, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared Peter Obi the winner of the 2010 Anambra State Gubernatorial election. He defeated Professor Charles Chukwuma Soludo, former governor, CBN. This election victory gave Governor Obi an additional four years as the governor of Anambra State</li>
        <li><span class="bold">2014-</span>On 17 March 2014 Peter Obi served out his second term and handed over the governorship to Willie Obiano.[36] After leaving office in 2014, Obi gained new status as an advocate for good governance and national political figure after decamping to the Peoples Democratic Party in 2014</li>
        <li><span class="bold">2015</span>After the 2015 General Election, President Goodluck Jonathan appointed Peter Obi as the chairman of the Nigerian Security and Exchange Commission (SEC).</li>
        <li><span class="bold">2018-</span>On 12 October 2018, Peter Obi was named as the running mate to Atiku Abubakar, the Peoples Democratic Party's Presidential Candidate in the 2019 presidential election. As a candidate for Vice President, Obi opposed proposals for a standardized national minimum wage, arguing that different states should have different minimum wages. The Abubakar/Obi ticket came second.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">2022-</span>On 24 March 2022, Peter Obi declared his intention to run for President of Nigeria under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, but later pulled out and announced he would be running under the Labour Party platform instead.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">2023-</span>The results were announced on 1 March 2023. Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress party, was named the president-elect with 8.79 million votes. Obi received 6.1 million votes, and won in both Lagos and Abuja.This put Obi in third place behind winner Bola Tinubu and People's Democratic Party nominee Atiku Abubakar. Due to the elections being rife with several allegations, reports and evidence of voter manipulation, disenfranchisement and rigging,Obi announced that he would challenge the election results, stating that, "We won the election and we will prove it to Nigerians".</li>
